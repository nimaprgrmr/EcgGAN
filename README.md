**ECG Signal Generation and Classification Using Conditional GANs and LSTM-CNN Models**

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop an advanced framework for generating and classifying Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a combination of deep learning models,
including Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for signal generation and an integrated LSTM-CNN model for signal classification.
The objective is to generate high-quality synthetic ECG signals conditioned on specific subject IDs and use these signals to build robust models capable of identifying
individual subjects based on their ECG patterns.

**Key Components:**
1 - Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction:

Raw ECG signals are preprocessed to normalize the data and extract key features such as RR intervals, mean, variance, and statistical properties of the signals.
A moving average technique is applied to both real and generated ECG signals to reduce noise and provide smoother signals for analysis and classification.
Dimensionality reduction using Autoencoder model is applied for high accuracy, and signals are padded or truncated to ensure consistent lengths across the dataset.


2 - Signal Generation Using cGANs:

A Conditional GAN (cGAN) architecture is used to generate synthetic ECG signals for each subject.
The generator is conditioned on the subject ID to ensure that the generated signals are personalized.
GAN is trained on encoded signals which is maded by encoder model, So after generating signals i used decoder to reconstructe signal as Ecg smooth signals.

3 - SVM-Based Real vs. Fake Detection:

Generated signals and real Ecg smooth signals are labeled and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify whether the signals are real or fake.
Extracted features from the ECG signals, such as mean and variance, are used to train the SVM model for binary classification of real vs. synthetic signals.
Signal Classification Using LSTM-CNN Model:

4 - A hybrid LSTM-CNN model is built to classify ECG signals and predict the subject ID based on the input signal.
The model combines LSTM layers for capturing temporal dependencies in the ECG signals and convolutional layers for extracting spatial features.
After training, the model is evaluated on both real and GAN-generated signals to assess its ability to identify subjects accurately.

**Challenges Addressed:**
- ECG signals are inherently noisy and complex. This project leverages deep learning models, including GANs and LSTM-CNNs, to generate and classify ECG signals effectively.
- The challenge of identifying individual subjects based on their ECG signals is tackled using sophisticated architectures that combine the strengths of both temporal and spatial feature extraction.

**Applications:**
- Healthcare: This project can be used in personalized medicine, where ECG data can be used to monitor patient health and detect anomalies.
- Biometric Identification: ECG signals can serve as a unique identifier for individuals, making this framework useful for biometric security systems.
- Data Augmentation: The GAN-generated synthetic ECG signals can serve as a valuable resource for training other deep learning models, especially in scenarios with limited data.

**Tools & Technologies:**
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models (Autoencoder, cGANs, LSTM-CNN).
- Python (NumPy, Pandas): For data preprocessing, feature extraction, and signal processing.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the SVM classification model.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing the results of the signal generation and classification.
